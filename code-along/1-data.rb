# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 3
# puts 5


# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 + 2
# puts 5 - 2
# puts 5 * 2

# Integers vs floats
# puts 5.0 / 2.0

# Order of operations
# puts (2+5) * 5

# Strings
# puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together
# puts "tacos are " + "delish"
# puts "tacos" * 3
# puts "tacos" + 3.to_s #converts integer to string

# Variables
# a = 10
# b = 3
# puts a * b

# food = "tacos"
# quantity = 3
# puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables
#first_name = "Boba"
# greeting = "Hello, " + first_name
#greeting = "Hello, #{first_name}"
#puts greeting

#puts "tacos #{3}"
#puts "#{food} #{quantity}"

# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".reverse
# puts "Hello".length

# creed = "This Is The Way"
# puts creed.upcase
